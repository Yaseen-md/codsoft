As a web developer intern at Codsoft, I designed a landing page as my first task. The goal was to create a simple landing page. I analyzed the given HTML and CSS codes, ensuring a well-organized structure and responsive design.

The HTML included a header with the company logo and navigation, and a hero section with a captivating banner and key benefits. CSS styles were implemented for fonts, colors, buttons, and interactive elements.

JavaScript was used to add smooth animations, like the hamburger menu icons. Thorough testing ensured cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness. Accessibility features, like alt text for images, were incorporated.

Working at Codsoft as an Intern has been a valuable learning experience. I am grateful for the mentorship and opportunities to contribute to projects. I look forward to sharing my work on GitHub and continuing to grow as a web developer.
